### Description
This project is a new revision of my developer portfolio, highlighting more of what I learned over the course of the full-stack web development bootcamp. It is a simple interface for learning a little about me, checking out some of the projects I've worked on or contributed to, and sending an inquiry if you'd like to hire me for some freelance work or to collaborate on a project.

### Accreditations

- Referenced most week 19 and week 20 activities, as well as components from most recent group project
- General Google searching and StackOverflow for assistance working through specific issues (deploying a React app, using `react-bootstrap`, `react-router-bootstrap`, and `react-mouse-particles` npm packages, etc.)

### Additional notes
- I've had some issues with the general layout styling, so this version is a little more bland than I would like. I will be continuing to work on it to get the styling more in line with what I want (and more exciting), as well as addition of more of the projects I've worked on.
